Done! Use Methods If your script needs to play a sound effect, reference the AudioManager game object. It is present in every scene so there is no need to create one. AudioManager.Play(string name); Plays the Sound that matches this name. AudioManager.Stop(string name); Stops playback of the Sound that matches this name. AudioManager.UpdatePitch(string name, float pitch); Updates the pitch of the Sound that matches this name to this pitch. Note that pitch is clamped between 0.1f and 3f.
